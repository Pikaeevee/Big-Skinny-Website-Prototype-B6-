            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">Are they durable?</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes, they last as long as regular leather wallets--our customers get 4-5 years of life from our nylon line. 
                  Our leather-nylon hybrid lines last 5+ years. 
                  We run into many of our first customers from 2005 that are still using them everyday even with the original materialâ€”we've since improved the material twice. 
                  Unlike regular wallets, Big Skinny wallets feature double-edged stitching which means the material is folded in, glued, and then stitched.</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">How much thinner and lighter than leather are they?</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>About 10 times thinner and lighter depending on the design and type of leather. 
                  That means once you start separating the wallet layers with your plastic and cash, our thin nylon material keeps your wallet 
                  at least 50% thinner than regular wallets that have thick leather layers. Most Big Skinny wallets weigh 1 ounce or less versus 3-6 ounces for most regular leather wallets. 
                  That also makes Big Skinnies more comfortable to carry in a pocket or a bag because leather is so much heavier. 
                  In fact Big Skinny wallet material is as thin as a regular business card--.21 mm!</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">Are Big Skinnies for men or women?</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Both men and women have been using them for years. Since everyone hates thick wallets, they are unisex. Now we have several distinct Women's 
                  and Men's designs but because they are so unisex in general, 
                  customers have been using Big Skinnies from both categories depending on their taste and needs.</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">Will the Big Skinny material stretch out?</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>It will stretch out a little over time but not to the degree that leather stretches out because leather is an animal-product while the Big Skinny is not. 
                  We've had customers give them a machine wash which tightens them a bit.
                </span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">What about change?</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Many of our models feature easy to access zippered compartments for change. For those models without zippered compartments, people often keep change in some 
                  of the pockets or billfold area-the non-slip interior helps keep a small amount of coins anchored nicely.</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">I'm looking for a gift but not sure which Big Skinny to buy? </div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span> Think about how many cards they carry and do you think they like to break them down into many pockets or not? If they have a few cards, then the regular bifold or trifold series is a good bet. 
                  If they have a medium amount of plastic cards but like to break them up into categories then the bifold, L-fold, or the world wallet is good especially if they travel outside the country because the world wallet fits all international bills. 
                  If they have a lot of plastic cards and you'd like to really see them slim down, then the super skinny or hipster will do the best job. 
                  Black is always a safe color and goes along with everything else.</span></div>

            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header">Are nylon micro-fiber Big Skinny wallets recyclable?  </div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span> yes, our nylon micro-fiber models are theoretically recyclable since they are petroleum-based products and some recycling places will take them -
                   check with the recycling plant first. Our wallet website is also green as we pay a monthly fee to trade for the requisite carbon credits that reflects our web energy usage. 
                   (Disclosure, our founder has worked and dined with Al Gore and respects, honors, and tries to keep everything as green as possible.)

              <div class="collapsible-header">Is it true that people who work at Big Skinny are the happiest employees in the northeast?  </div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>  Yes, the rumor is true. Must be the proximity to Dunkin Donuts and the ever-streaming of music like "Forever Young", Henry Mancini, and Joao Gilberto coming from the computers all day long.
